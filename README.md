# ShinyFishData 🐟

This is option B


## Repository contents

Welcome to the Shiny Fish Data repository! Here you will find the contents for the STAT545B Shiny App assignment. I decided to do a demonstration of some interactive data exploration of one of my datasets, *CTmax_swim_Fry*. On the dashboard you will be able to interact with fork length measurements and dropout temperatures as sorted by mass and acclimation treatment through histograms and tables; interact with the dataset as a whole and download the dataset; look at some fish and watch them swim.

Enjoy!
